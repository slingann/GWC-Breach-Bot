# Breach Bot (GWC SPP)

### 👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
This is a chabot I coded using Python skills I gained through the GWC Self-Paced Program in 2022. Users answer the chatbot's prompts to learn about cybersecurity and the 2019 Facebook data breach.

### 💡 My Inspiration
Although this was an assignment/project for the program, I'm quite interested in cybersecurity and the relationship between humans and technology. I believe that it is important for one's data to be used and stored fairly and securely by companies and others. Everyone has the right to privacy, even when using technology.
